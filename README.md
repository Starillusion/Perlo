A nice chat server you can use on your home network to talk with friends, or set up a overnight stay at 
a friend's huge house that you don't want to yell across or run a long way.

But you'll still need to set it up, I didn't set it up for you.
Setup:
 
 Step 1: Clone the repository onto your computer or developmentdevelopment machine (BeagleBone BlackBlack, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

 Step 2: Open the server directory and open the config.json file.
